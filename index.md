Hello and welcome! Red Finch aims to produce great quality Perch CMS add-ons that are open source and freely available for anyone to use.

Building great websites using Perch is easy and flexible, giving clients plenty of control without limiting your creativity - but sometimes collections can only go so far. We would like to fill in these gaps with simple, purposeful add-ons that can really move your projects forward.

If you have any requests or queries you can let us know on GitHub and we'll do our best to accommodate.
