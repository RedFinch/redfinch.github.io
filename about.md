## Who, what and why?

Red Finch was created by [James Wigger](https://jameswigger.co.uk) to provide a single, recognisable name under which reliable and useful Perch addons, plugins and utilities could be released. Inspired by the *The League of Extraordinary Packages*. 

Having worked with Perch on numerous projects, from small portfolios to large public sector websites and developing private add-ons for these projects, it felt the right time to give back to the community through open-source software. 

The aim is to expand into a collective that fills in any gaps that Perch and its official add-ons leave for the benefit of all within the Perch community.

All are welcome to contribute - be it through submitting pull requests, requesting listing on our page or simply by asking for something new. Every suggestion, line of code or critique makes the Perch ecosystem stronger.
